# ticket-tracking

This is a project to speed up actioning alerts in Sumo Logic CSE.

Long-term plans are to have this program accessing a local database of past tickets for autosuggestion, updating past tickets instead of writing new notes (pending user escalation, etc), and generating reports automatically. 

Complete WIP, no functionality is guaranteed.
